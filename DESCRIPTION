Description: An R interface for the vouch project, which bills itself as
    "a community trust management system based on explicit vouches to
    participate". vouch is a Nushell module, so voucher provides an R API
    to modify the VOUCHED.td database without Nushell. voucher does not
    depend on vouch or Nushell.
