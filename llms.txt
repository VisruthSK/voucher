# voucher

[voucher](https://github.com/VisruthSK/voucher) is a R interface to a
[Trustdown
database](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/?tab=readme-ov-file#vouched-file-format)
as used by [`vouch`](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/), a “community
trust management system based on explicit vouches to participate.” This
package directly interacts with the vouched file format and doesn’t rely
on `vouch` or Nushell.

From the `vouch` README:

> People must be **vouched for** before interacting with certain parts
> of a project (the exact parts are configurable to the project to
> enforce). People can also be explicitly **denounced** to block them
> from interacting with the project.

Read more about why you may want to use vouching in the [`vouch`
README](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/?tab=readme-ov-file#why).

## What `voucher` provides

Subset of `vouch`’s behavior:

- Initialize a project trust file (`VOUCHED.td`) with
  [`use_vouch()`](https://visruthsk.github.io/voucher/reference/use_vouch.md)
- Add vouched contributors with
  [`add()`](https://visruthsk.github.io/voucher/reference/add.md)
- Denounce contributors with
  [`denounce()`](https://visruthsk.github.io/voucher/reference/denounce.md)
- Check status (`vouched`, `denounced`, `unknown`) of users with
  [`check()`](https://visruthsk.github.io/voucher/reference/check.md)
- Add vouch GitHub Actions workflows with
  [`vouch_gha()`](https://visruthsk.github.io/voucher/reference/vouch_gha.md)

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("VisruthSK/voucher")
```

## Small workflow

``` r
library(voucher)

# Initialize vouch files in the current project
use_vouch()

add("alice", write = TRUE)
denounce("spammer", reason = "spam", write = TRUE)

# Check status
check(c("alice","spammer"))
# Can also try to check git blame
check(c("alice","spammer"), blame = TRUE)

# Add GitHub Action workflows
vouch_gha(c("check-issue", "check-pr"))
```
