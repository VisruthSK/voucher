\details{
check-issue: Check if an issue author is a vouched contributor. Bots and collaborators with write access are automatically allowed. Denounced users are always blocked. When require-vouch is true (default), unvouched users are also blocked. Use auto-close to close issues from blocked users.

check-pr: Check if a PR author is a vouched contributor. Bots and collaborators with write access are automatically allowed. Denounced users are always blocked. When require-vouch is true (default), unvouched users are also blocked. Use auto-close to close PRs from blocked users.

manage-by-discussion: Manage contributor vouch status via discussion comments. When a collaborator with sufficient permissions comments vouch on a discussion, the discussion author is added to the vouched contributors list. When they comment denounce, the user is denounced. When they comment unvouch, the user is removed from the list entirely. The trigger keywords and required permission levels are configurable.

manage-by-issue: Manage contributor vouch status via issue comments. When a collaborator with sufficient permissions comments vouch on an issue, the issue author is added to the vouched contributors list. When they comment denounce, the user is denounced. When they comment unvouch, the user is removed from the list entirely. The trigger keywords and required permission levels are configurable.

sync-codeowners: Sync CODEOWNERS entries into the VOUCHED list. The action expands any team owners to their members and adds missing users to the vouch file.
